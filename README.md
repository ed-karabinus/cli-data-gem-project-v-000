# wiki_on_this_day

This gem scrapes the English-language Wikipedia homepage (at https://en.wikipedia.org) to obtain the various article abstracts from the "On This Day" historical section of the homepage. To install, head over to RubyGems.org to obtain the latest version of this gem (under the name "wiki_on_this_day"). Upon gem installation, type wiki_on_this_day to access the command-line interface with the scraped information. After viewing the list of daily abstracts, you may request more information about any particular event by typing its year (Typing anything else will quit the program; restart and try again in this case.)

Do not hesitate to fork this repository and improve wiki_on_this_day; I welcome any pull requests with bug fixes, display improvements, or more features.
